# GuessR

GuessR is a web-based game developed as part of the first-year project for the DUT STID (Statistics and Business Intelligence) at IUT Lumi√®re Lyon 2, France, during the 2018-2019 academic year. The objective of this project was to apply the knowledge acquired during web programming courses by creating a game inspired by [Guess the Correlation](http://guessthecorrelation.com). Development was conducted by group #3.

## Overview

In GuessR, the main goal is to test your ability to guess **[the correlation between two variables using a scatter plot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence)**. The game is designed to encourage players to hone their understanding of correlations and statistical relationships.

Players make their correlation guesses, and the game rewards them based on the proximity of their estimate to the true correlation value. **The closer** the guess is to the true correlation value, **the more points the player earns**. 

A **ranking system** is implemented to showcase the highest-scoring players, motivating healthy competition and encouraging players to achieve better results *(requires a database)*.

## About the game

The name "GuessR" is a clever combination of "Guess" and "R," where "R" stands for the notation used to represent the correlation coefficient. The name is a nod to the statistical aspect of the game, highlighting its focus on correlation estimation. Additionally, the name bears resemblance to "guesser," aptly reflecting the nature of the game as a correlation guessing challenge.
